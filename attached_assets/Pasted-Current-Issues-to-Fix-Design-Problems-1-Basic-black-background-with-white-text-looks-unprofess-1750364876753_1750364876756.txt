Required Improvements
1. Email Template Design (email-templates.js)
Update the email templates with:
Visual Design:
â€¢	Modern, professional color scheme (suggest: white/light gray background, navy blue accents, touches of warm orange/gold)
â€¢	Clear typography hierarchy (use web-safe fonts like Georgia for headers, Arial/Helvetica for body)
â€¢	Proper spacing and padding (minimum 20px padding, 1.5 line height)
â€¢	Mobile-responsive design (max-width: 600px, centered)
â€¢	Subtle visual elements (borders, dividers, icons if possible)
â€¢	Professional but warm aesthetic
HTML Structure:
html
<!-- Use this enhanced structure -->
<div style="background-color: #f5f5f5; padding: 40px 20px;">
  <div style="max-width: 600px; margin: 0 auto; background-color: #ffffff; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">
    <!-- Header with branding -->
    <div style="background: linear-gradient(135deg, #2c3e50 0%, #3498db 100%); color: white; padding: 40px 30px; border-radius: 8px 8px 0 0;">
      <h1 style="margin: 0; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 32px; font-weight: normal;">GO</h1>
      <p style="margin: 10px 0 0 0; font-size: 16px; opacity: 0.9;">Your Leadership Development Journey</p>
    </div>
    
    <!-- Content area -->
    <div style="padding: 40px 30px;">
      <!-- Main content here -->
    </div>
    
    <!-- Footer -->
    <div style="padding: 30px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-top: 1px solid #e9ecef; border-radius: 0 0 8px 8px;">
      <p style="margin: 0; color: #6c757d; font-size: 14px; text-align: center;">
        Week {weekNumber} of 12 â€¢ Your personalized leadership journey
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
2. AI Service Enhancement (ai-service.js)
Replace the current AI prompts with sophisticated ones:
For Goal Analysis:
javascript
const analyzeGoals = async (goals) => {
  const prompt = `You are Dr. Sarah Chen, a renowned executive coach with 20+ years working with Fortune 500 leaders.

ANALYZE THESE LEADERSHIP GOALS:
"${goals}"

Provide:
1. Deep psychological insights about what's driving these goals
2. Recognition of the leadership competencies they're developing
3. A sophisticated first action that creates meaningful momentum

Requirements:
- Reference specific elements from their goals
- Show genuine understanding of leadership challenges
- Create psychologically engaging actions, not generic tasks
- Write warmly but professionally

Format:
FEEDBACK: [2-3 sentences of nuanced analysis]
ACTION: [Specific, meaningful week 1 action]`;
For Weekly Emails:
javascript
const generateWeeklyEmail = async ({ goals, weekNumber, previousAction, previousActions }) => {
  const developmentalStage = weekNumber <= 3 ? "self-awareness" : 
                            weekNumber <= 8 ? "skill application" : 
                            "integration and mastery";
  
  const prompt = `You are Dr. Sarah Chen, continuing to coach a leader in week ${weekNumber} of 12.

Context:
- Original goals: "${goals}"
- Development stage: ${developmentalStage}
- Last week's action: "${previousAction}"
- Journey progression: ${previousActions.join("; ")}

Create a sophisticated weekly email that:
1. Acknowledges their specific progress meaningfully
2. Builds psychologically on previous weeks
3. Provides an action that directly serves their goals
4. Feels personally relevant and engaging

Requirements:
- Reference leadership psychology principles
- Create actions that take 30-60 minutes
- Maintain optimal challenge (not too easy/hard)
- Show cumulative growth understanding

Format:
PRAISE: [2-4 words acknowledging last week]
ACTION: [Sophisticated, specific action for this week]
CONNECTION: [One sentence tying to their leadership vision]`;
3. Content Examples
Week 1 Welcome Email:
Subject: Welcome to GO - Your Leadership Transformation Begins

Hi [Name],

I've reviewed your leadership goals and I'm genuinely excited about the journey ahead. Your desire to [specific goal reference] demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of what modern leadership requires.

What strikes me most is [personalized insight about their goals]. This kind of self-awareness is the foundation of exceptional leadership.

ðŸŽ¯ Your First Action:
This week, conduct a "leadership moment audit." Identify three specific interactions where you exercised leadership (formal or informal). For each, write down:
- What you did well
- What felt challenging
- What you'd do differently now

This self-reflection practice will accelerate your growth throughout our 12 weeks together.

Looking forward to your transformation,
Dr. Sarah Chen
Week 5 Email Example:
Subject: Week 5: Mastering Difficult Conversations

Well done on last week's feedback experiment!

ðŸŽ¯ This Week's Challenge:
Design a "crucial conversation" you've been postponing. Map out:
1. The core issue (facts vs. stories)
2. What you really want for yourself, others, and the relationship
3. How to create psychological safety for dialogue

Then have the conversation, focusing on curiosity over convincing.

This directly builds the communication excellence you identified as crucial to your leadership vision.
